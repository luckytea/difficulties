The default values are based on the "strive to survive" difficulty level. Flashstorm, toxic fallout and volcanic winter are disabled in Peaceful difficulty level.

The difficulty is selected separately from the storyteller, but both are changeable mid-game.

## AI Storytellers

The AI Storyteller creates events like pirate raids, resource drops, or animal attacks. Their choices will affect the story of your colony. You can change these settings at any time.

AI storytellers are driving the gameplay and their choices will affect the story of your colony, but will never entirely disallow events because of population. They create events like pirate raids, resource drops, or animal attacks.

The one that you choose will make decisions about what events it wants you to encounter and when based on the situation you are currently in and on the biases of that particular AI.

Choosing an AI will have a great influence on the narrative that is formed as you play.

### Cassandra Classic

The default storyteller. Cassandra creates story events on a classic increasing curve of challenge and tension. She'll push you with dangerous events, then give breathing room, then come back to push once more.

### Phoebe Chillax

Phoebe gives lots of time between disasters to build your colony. But beware - at high difficulties, she'll hit as hard as anyone.

### Randy Random

Randy doesn't follow rules. He'll generate random events, and he doesn't care if they make a story of triumph or utter hopelessness. It's all drama to him.

Warning: Since Randy is truly random, he will sometimes send extremely difficult or unfair groups of events at you. It makes for high drama - and unavoidable sacrifices.

## Save mode

### Reload any time mode

You can save and load the game at any time.

This is a good choice if you're still learning the game, if it fits your personal playstyle, if you're using mods that may break your game, or if you intend to self-enforce commitment mode.

### Commitment mode

You can only save when quitting the game.

Since RimWorld is a story generator, even losing all but one person is not the end of the game - it's part of the story. The game is designed to allow recovery after losses.

Playing out these terrible situations makes a story with both tragedy and triumph. It's the way RimWorld was designed to be played.

There's a reason Luke Skywalker didn't quit and reload when his family got killed - loss and recovery is dramatic.
