## Experience System

Additionally, the choice of experience system affects the complexity of the game.

### Oddity

The Oddity XP System is an alternative experience system where most experience is gained from finding oddities.
This mode is the way the game is meant to be played.

### Classic

In the Classic XP System, experience is rewarded for quest completion, kills and skill usage.
This mode is leftover from early development.
