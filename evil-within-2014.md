### Casual

Casual is the easiest setting of The Evil Within, and offers more of a narrative experience than actual survival horror. Enemies encountered in this mode are expectedly weak, dumb, and bosses do not take much effort at all to kill. Burning corpses with matches or torches is almost redundant on Casual due to the reduced enemy health and abundant ammo finds. Auto-aim is enabled by default and enemy awareness icons are fully-visible.
Casual is unlocked from the get-go along with Survival. Enemy attack strength on Casual is halved, and most creatures bar Ruvik in the final chapter have 75% health.
