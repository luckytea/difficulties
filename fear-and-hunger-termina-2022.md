## Game mechanics

### Time limit

According to the plot, the events of the story last only three days, but depending on the level of difficulty, the game can start from the last day.

Every time after using sleep, the time of day changes - morning, lunch, evening.

### Save game mechanics

You can only save in a special location on the beds, but not every bed is safe. Sometimes your sleep can be interrupted by the appearance of a monster.

Each sleep consumes time, so the total time spent on saves is limited to 9. But you can use special items to save without wasting time.
